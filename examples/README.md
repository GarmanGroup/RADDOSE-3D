# Examples

Examples of running RADDOSE-3D include:
- [Using a PDB entry](https://github.com/GarmanGroup/RADDOSE-3D/tree/master/examples/PDB_example.md)
- [Calculating doses in SAXS experiments](https://github.com/GarmanGroup/RADDOSE-3D/tree/master/examples/SAXS_example.md)

### Special cases
For special cases (e.g.sample/crystal isvery big or very small or the total rotation range in the experiment is small or no rotation at all) read this section for [tips on running RADDOSE-3D](https://github.com/GarmanGroup/RADDOSE-3D#considerations-when-running-raddose-3d-for-some-special-cases) to get the best results.

### Dealing with errors
Running software programs inevitably comes with its ups and downs. Typically the downs are errors that are thrown when trying to run the program. We've [compiled a list of the common errors (Gotchas)](https://github.com/GarmanGroup/RADDOSE-3D#gotchas-when-running-raddose-3d) that you may see when running RADDOSE-3D along with guidelines and suggestions on how to avoid them.
