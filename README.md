RADDOSE-3D - time- and space-resolved modelling of dose in macromolecular crystallography.
==========================================================================================  

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GarmanGroup/RADDOSE-3D.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GarmanGroup/RADDOSE-3D)

RADDOSE-3D allows the macroscopic modelling of an X-ray diffraction
experiment for the purpose of better predicting radiation-damage progression.
The distribution of dose within the crystal volume is calculated for a number
of iterations in small angular steps across one or more data collection
wedges, providing a time-resolved picture of the dose state of the crystal.
The code is highly modular so that future contributions from the community
can be easily integrated into it, in particular to incorporate online methods
for determining the shape of macromolecular crystals and better protocols for
imaging real experimental X-ray beam profiles.
