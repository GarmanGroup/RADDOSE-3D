Raddose3D
=========
  RADDOSE-3D - time- and space-resolved modelling of dose in macromolecular
  crystallography.
  
  RADDOSE-3D allows the macroscopic modelling of an X-ray diffraction
  experiment for the purpose of better predicting radiation-damage progression.
  The distribution of dose within the crystal volume is calculated for a number
  of iterations in small angular steps across one or more data collection
  wedges, providing a time-resolved picture of the dose state of the crystal.
  The code is highly modular so that future contributions from the community
  can be easily integrated into it, in particular to incorporate online methods
  for determining the shape of macromolecular crystals and better protocols for
  imaging real experimental X-ray beam profiles.
