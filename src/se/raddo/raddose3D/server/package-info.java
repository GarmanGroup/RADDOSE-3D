/**
 * RADDOSE-3D server
 * time- and space-resolved modelling of dose in macromolecular crystallography.
 * 
 * This is a sample implementation of a RADDOSE-3D server, regularly looking
 * for new jobs to process from a database, starting RADDOSE-3D instances and
 * writing the results back into the database.
